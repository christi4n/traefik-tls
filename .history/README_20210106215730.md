# Traefik + TLS

This is a template I've done but I was heavily inspired by other repos. This allows you to use Traefik as a reverse proxy. You have to declare a local domain and several subdomains for each of your service in the docker-compose file.
If you are using portainer, declare the host as portainer + the selected domain name. 
The most interesting part is that you can use many services with the same port. Traefik will redirect the trafic to the service called by its subdomain.
Be aware that Traefik creates its own network.

## Benefits

- Don't touch your /etc/hosts file
- Get a trusted certificate, generate certificates automatically inside a container and share these certificates inside a volume
- Use a intelligent reverse proxy that get automatically updated when containers are destroyed or down.

## Install and configuration

Edit .env file.
DOMAIN_NAME is the domain you are using. Mine is docker.localhost
PROJECT_NAME is the main project name and it is appended to your container names. 
Keep the network name the same as the project name.

Edit ./docker-certs/tls/Dockerfile
Add into the run command the domains you whould like to generate the certificates for.

## Make certs manually

It is also possible but comment the "docker-certs-tls" service in the docker-compse.yaml file.

```
$ mkcert -cert-file certs/local-cert.pem -key-file certs/local-key.pem "docker.localhost" "*.docker.localhost"
```

### Launch

Go to the directory where the Make file is located and launch:

```
$ make network
$ make install
```

You can also destroy at the end all containers with:

```
$ make uninstall
```

### Traefix dashboard

The dashboard is enabled with the following option in the traefik/traefik.toml file

```
[api]
  dashboard = true
```

You can access the dashboard with the following url: https://your.local-domain:8080/dashboard/#/
Mine is accessible this way: http://docker.localhost:8080/dashboard/#/
